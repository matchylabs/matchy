# Matchy WASM Demo

Interactive demo for matchy-wasm running entirely in the browser.

## Running Locally

```bash
# From the matchy-wasm crate directory
./demo/serve.sh
```

This will:
1. Build the WASM package with `wasm-pack`
2. Start a local HTTP server at http://localhost:8080

## Integrating with the Book

The demo can be served as part of the matchy documentation book:

```bash
# Build WASM into book output
wasm-pack build crates/matchy-wasm --target web --out-dir ../../book/book/demo/pkg

# Copy demo files
cp crates/matchy-wasm/demo/index.html book/book/demo/
```

Then access at: `https://your-site.github.io/matchy/demo/`

## Files

- `index.html` - Self-contained demo page (no build step needed)
- `serve.sh` - Helper script to build and serve locally
- `pkg/` - Built WASM package (generated by wasm-pack)
